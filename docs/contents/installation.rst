Installation
============

You'll need a Linux or OS X system with `Docker <https://docker.com>`_ installed.

The different REY services can be run using REY's command-line interface `rey-cli <https://github.com/reputation-network/rey-cli>`_. To install ``rey-cli``, simply run this command:

.. code::

    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reputation-network/rey-cli/master/bin/rey-cli-install.sh | sh

You will have the ``rey-cli`` command available in your path. Type ``rey-cli`` to view the help.
