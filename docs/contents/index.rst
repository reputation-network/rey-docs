The Reputation Network, or REY, is a platform that enables safe, traceable personal data processing. It can be used by banks to use next-generation credit scores that safely use personal data from different data sources. It can also be used simply as a safer alternative to OAuth. Or it can be used to perform simple checks on personal data, like income checks based on credit card data, without letting the client know the subjectâ€™s actual monthly income.

This is the documentation for building and deploying REY apps.

.. note::
    There is a `tech paper that discusses the Reputation Network design details <https://reputation.network/papers/tech>`_ in depth. For a conceptual description, the former paper is the reference to check.
